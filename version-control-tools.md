*   **Git Projects**: Git tool used for two types of git projects. Local git projects and distributed git projects.
*   **Local Git Projects**: Local git projects are the projects that are stored on the local machine.
*   **Distributed Git Projects**: Distributed git projects are the projects that are stored on a remote server and local machine.

*   **Git Servers**: Many git servers is available in internet. The famous git servers are GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
*   **Github**: It mostly used for open source projects. https://github.com is this server link.
*   **Gitlab**: It mostly used for private projects. https://gitlab.com is this server link.
*   **Bitbucket**: It is used for private projects. It's security is better than github and gitlab. https://bitbucket.org is this server link.
