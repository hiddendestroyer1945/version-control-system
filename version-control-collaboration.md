# Version Control Collaboration
*   **Description**: To explain about the version control collaboration, type of collaborations, steps of collaboration, features of collaboration, benefits of collaboration and execution of collaboration.

*   **Version Control Collaboration**: It is a process of working together on a project using version control system. It is used to manage the project files and collaborate with others. This allows you to give different permissions to different people in a remote repository.

*   **Version Control Collaboration Type**: There are three types of collaborations. They are solo collaboration, team collaboration and open source collaboration.
    *   **Solo Collaboration**: It is a process of working on a project by yourself. It give the read and clone permission the project files to collaborators. That permission give to client only.
    *   **Team Collaboration**: It is a process of working on a project with a team. It is used to manage the project files and collaborate with others. This allows you to give different permissions to different people in a remote repository. But project management team are decided this collaborators in advance and requesting to them.
    *   **Open Source Collaboration**: It is a process of working on a project with a team. It is used to manage the project files and collaborate with others. This allows you to give different permissions to different people in a remote repository. But project management team don't knowing its collaborators, so collaborators requesting to project management team in this.

*   **Team Collaboration Steps**: There are some steps of team collaboration. They are repositories creation, branches creation, project guideline docs development, project plan development, pulling the main branch, merging master branch into main branch, pushing the main branch, pushing the development management feature branch, pushing the feature branches, setup the collaborators, work requesting, cloning specific feature branch, pushing feature branches, Pulling feature branches, merging the feature branches, and pushing the main branch.
    *   **Repositories Creation**: Creating the remote repository and local repository for this.
    *   **Branches Creation**: Creating the branches in local repository for this.
    *   **Project Guideline Docs Development**: Creating the project guideline docs for this. Used for this doc is README.md. This doc is developed in master branch.
    *   **Project Plan Development**: Creating the project plan for this. Used for this docs is prd, tdd, sow register. It's developed in development management feature branch.
    *   **Pulling the Main Branch**: Pulling the main branch from remote repository to local repository.

    *   **Setup the Collaborators**:Setup the whole feature branches collaborators in remote repository for team collaboration.
    *   **Work Requesting**: Requesting work via discussion to collaborators of feature branches.
    *   **Cloning Specific Feature Branch**: Cloning the specific feature branch from remote repository to local system of collaborators.
    *   **Pushing the Feature Branches**: Each collaborators pushing their feature branches in remote repository, after work is completed of each work request. Then informed this to development management feature branch via discussion comment.
    *   **Pulling the Feature Branches**: Each collaborator's feature branches in remote repository is pulling to local repository of development management feature branch.
    *   **Merging the Feature Branches**: Merging the development feature branches into main branch of local repository for get the development files.
    *   **Pushing the Main Branch**: Pushing the main branch to remote repository after completing the project.

*   **Open Source Collaboration Steps**: There are some steps of open source collaboration. They are repositories creation, branches creation, project guideline docs development, project plan development, pulling the main branch, merging master branch into main branch, pushing the main branch, pushing the development management feature branch, pushing the feature branches, work posting, forking remote repository, cloning specific feature branch, pushing feature branches, Pulling feature branches, merging the feature branches, and pushing the main branch.
    *   **Repositories Creation**: Creating the remote repository, local repository and project management remote repository for this.
    *   **Branches Creation**: Creating the branches in local repository for this.
    *   **Project Guideline Docs Development**: Creating the project guideline docs for this. Used for this doc is README.md. This doc is developed in master branch.

    *   **Pulling the Main Branch**: Pulling the main branch from remote repository to local repository.
    *   **Merging Master Branch into Main Branch**: Merging the master branch into main branch for get the README file.
    *   **Pushing the Development Management Feature Branch**: Pushing the development management feature branch to project management remote repository for get the project plan docs.
    *   **Pushing the Feature Branches**: Pushing the feature branches to remote repository for get the feature branches.
    *   **Work Publishing**: Publishing works in specific website.
    *   **Forking Remote Repository**: Forking remote repository to collaborators git server profile.
    *   **Cloning Specific Feature Branch**: Cloning the specific feature branch from collaborators forked remote repository to local system of collaborators.
    *   **Pushing the Feature Branches**: Each collaborators pushing their feature branches in collabrator's remote repository, after work is completed of each works. Then informed this to development management feature branch via email.
    *   **Pulling the Feature Branches**: Each collaborator's feature branches in remote repository is pulling to local repository of development management feature branch.
    *   **Merging the Feature Branches**: Merging the development feature branches into main branch of local repository for get the development files.
    *   **Pushing the Main Branch**: Pushing the main branch to remote repository after completing the project.

*   **Features of Collaboration**: There are some features of collaboration. They are branching, merging, version control, distributed system and pull request.
    *   **Branching**: Collaboration allows collaborators, to activities independently on the project by creating other feature branches in the remote repository in addition to the main branch, without affecting the project's activities. Collaboration allows these collaborators to perform necessary work on the project without affecting the main activities of the project.
    *   **Merging**: Collaboration allows collaborators to merge activities completed by other collaborators on feature branches created in project's remote repository into the main branch of the remote repository.
    *   **Version Control**: Collaboration allows collaborators to track project activities by creating a history for each activity in the project. Collaboration allows collaborators to complete a series of actions on a project, build histories of those actions, and then return to the history built for a specific action.
    *   **Distributed System**: Collaboration allows collaborators to store a copy of a project's activites and its history in their local repository, and for each collaborator to activities offline on such local repositories and then make those activities available to the project's remote repository after completing the activities.
    *   **Pull Request**: Collaboration allows collaborators to analyze the activities of the project that is made available to the project's collaborators' feature branches in the project's remote repository and ensure that these activities do not contain errors or bugs before merging them into the main branch in the remote repository.

*   **Benefits of Collaboration**: Collaboration brings some benefits to the project. they are  improved code quality, efficiency, version history and reduce risk of conflicts.
    *   **Improved Code Quality**: Collaboration allows collaborators to improve the quality of the code by ensuring that the code is free of errors and bugs before merging it into the main branch in the remote repository.
    *   **Efficiency**: Collaboration allows collaborators to improve the efficiency of the project by allowing them to work independently on the project without affecting the main activities of the project. Additionally, since each type of project activity has its own feature branch, collaborators can work on different aspects of the project at the same time, thereby increasing the efficiency of the project.
    *   **Version History**: Collaboration allows collaborators to track the each activity in  project using each activity's history. Collaboration allows collaborators to complete a series of actions on a project, build histories of those actions, and then return to the history built for a specific action.
    *   **Reduce Risk of Conflicts**: Collaboration allows for reducing the risk of conflict by allowing collaborators to work independently on the project without affecting the main activities of the project, as each type of project activity has its own feature branch. Additionly collaboration allows to It also ensure that the activities in the feature branches for the project's proposed activities does not contain errors or bugs before merging it into the main branch of the project. Collaboration allows collaborators to track project activities by creating a history for each activity in the project and, if an activity is errored, to return to the history of the activity immediately preceding that activity.

*   **Local Repository Collaboration**: Explaining the local repository branches related collaboration commands.
