# Version Control Project Management
*   **Description**: To explain about the version control project management, version control project management tools, prd building, srs building, tdd building, test plan building, tsr building,sow building, work request building, work request reply and work statement.

*   **Version Control Project Management**: Project management is the application of tools and techniques to activities to meet project requirements. Software development, hardware development, and cybersecurity activities are done as projects on Git servers. Such projects are managed by the Development Management Feature Branch. Development management feature branch manages projects using certain strategies and the files that implement those strategies.

*   **Project Management Tools**: Project management tools are the tools that are used to manage projects. These tools are used to manage the project's lifecycle, including planning, execution, and monitoring. For this, the following files are used PRD, SRS, TDD, Test Plan, TSR, SOW Register, Work Request, Work Request Reply and Work Statement.
    *   **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: PRD is a document that outlines the requirements for a product. It is used to define the scope of the project and to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.
    *   **SRS (Software Requirements Specification)**: SRS is a document that outlines the requirements for a software product. It is used to define the scope of the project and to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.
    *   **TDD (Technical Design Document)**: TDD is a document that outlines the technical design for a software product. It is used to define the scope of the design and to ensure that the design is completed on time and within budget.
    *   **Test Plan**: Test plan is a document that outlines the testing process for a product. It is used to define the scope of the testing and to ensure that the testing is completed on time and within budget.
    *   **TSR (Test Summary Report)**: TSR is used to communicate the results of product testing and report the condition of the product.
    *   **SOW (Statement of Work)**: SOW is a document that outlines the work to be done for a project. It is used to define the scope of the project and to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.
    *   **Work Request**: A work request is a document that outlines each specific task to be performed for a project. It is used to define the scope of the proposed work and ensure that the work is completed on time and within budget.
    *   **Work Request Reply**: A work request reply is a document that outlines the response to a work request. 
    *   **Work Statement**: A work statement is a document that outlines the work completed on a project. It is used to ensure that each task completed on the project was completed on time and within budget.
